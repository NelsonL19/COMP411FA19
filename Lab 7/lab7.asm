#  Best is to convert the C program line by line
#    into its assembly equivalent. 
#
#
#  1.  First, read m (the matrices will then be size mxm).
#  2.  Next, read matrix A followed by matrix B.
#  3.  Compute matrix product.  You will need triple-nested loops for this.
#  4.  Print the result, one row per line, with one (or more) space(s) between
#      values within a row.
#  5.  Exit.
